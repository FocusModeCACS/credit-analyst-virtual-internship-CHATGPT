This folder contains weekly summaries and key insights from my ,50-week virtual Credit Analyst Internship simulation.
Each summary outlines the core tasks completed, financial concepts learned, tools used (e.g., Excel, Python), and takeaways relevant to corporate credit analysis, risk assessment, and fixed income research.

These overviews help track progress, reflect on credit evaluation skills developed, and serve as a high-level audit trail of my internship performance.
