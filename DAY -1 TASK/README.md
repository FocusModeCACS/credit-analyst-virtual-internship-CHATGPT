🚀 Day 1 Task: Sector & Company Credit Scan (Automotive Sector)

On Day 1 of my virtual credit analyst internship, I conducted a comprehensive sector and company credit scan focused on the automotive industry.

The goal of this task was to simulate how real-world credit analysts begin building their coverage universe by understanding key industry players, credit profiles, and recent developments.

🏎️ Sector Chosen: Automotive

I selected the automotive sector due to its dynamic nature, global scale, and significant exposure to transformative trends such as electric vehicles (EV), supply chain shifts, and sustainability pressures.

🔍 Key Components:

Issuer Identification: Selected five major global automotive companies that actively issue bonds and maintain corporate debt portfolios: Toyota, Ford, Volkswagen, General Motors, and Tesla.

Credit Ratings Analysis: Researched and documented each issuer’s latest credit ratings from major agencies (Moody’s, S&P, Fitch), providing a snapshot of market-perceived credit quality.

Recent News Scan: Summarized recent strategic or operational developments impacting credit risk, such as product recalls, EV investments, restructurings, or rating changes.

Key Financial Metrics: Collected and analyzed crucial credit indicators like Debt/Equity ratios and Interest Coverage ratios to assess leverage and financial health.


📈 Outcome:

This initial scan helped build a foundational understanding of issuer risk profiles within the sector and laid the groundwork for deeper peer comparisons and credit modeling tasks in the following days.

The exercise also sharpened my skills in data gathering, industry research, and concise credit-focused summarization — essential tools for any aspiring credit analyst.
